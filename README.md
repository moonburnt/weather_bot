# WeatherBot

## Description

**WeatherBot** - a simple weather bot for telegram. Its asynchronous and supports
both dm and inline modes. As for right now, its powered by https://www.wttr.in/,
but I may add support for other APIs later.

## TODO

- Ability to fetch weather data from different sources (google/yandex/gismeteo/etc).
- Requests caching - only download info from api if local copy is out of date.
- Ability to retrieve forecasts, not just current weather.
